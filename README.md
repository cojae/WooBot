# WooBot

Raspberry Pi application, used with the basic raspberry pi camera.  Purpose is to sit inside of the office and show people walking in with their face changed to Ric Flair and a Ric Flair 'Woo' or another Ric Flair phrase.  

The entire thing is pretty configurable and the image used can be changed with minor changes to code.  The sound files are more easily changed as you just have to add or remove from the ./sounds/ directory.

# Installation Instructions

Install Raspbian on raspberry pi 3 or 4.  Install camera (instructions online).  Will need to install python3-opencv and pygame, but everything else used should be part of python3, I believe
